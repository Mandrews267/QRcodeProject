## My process

I completed the HTML and then implemented the CSS styles, continuously reviewing the page as I made changes.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learned a little more about using the flexbox library in this tutorial.

### Continued development
I am currently working on growing my knowledge of CSS and how to implement creating stylish web sites and applications.  
I am also working on learning OOP features of JavaScript, even though this project does not include any JavaScript.
